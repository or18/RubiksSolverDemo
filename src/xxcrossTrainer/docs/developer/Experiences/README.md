**[malloc_trim_wasm_verification.md](malloc_trim_wasm_verification.md)** - **Cross-platform verification**
- Native vs WASM malloc_trim() behavior
- Test results (3 scenarios):
  - Simple allocation: 0 MB freed (already freed by delete[])

- Production deployment guidance

**Key Findings**:
- malloc_trim() reduces native RSS by 225 MB (50%)
- WASM cannot use malloc_trim() (Emscripten limitation)
- Native WASM-equivalent measurement: DISABLE_MALLOC_TRIM=1
- Allocator cache: ~16 MB (8M/8M/8M)

---

### 📖 disable_malloc_trim Usage Guide (2026-01-02) - NEW

**[disable_malloc_trim_usage.md](disable_malloc_trim_usage.md)** - **WASM deployment planning guide**
- Problem statement: Native measurements underestimate WASM memory
- Solution: WASM-equivalent measurement mode on native
- Usage examples and decision tree
- Memory comparison table (native vs WASM-equivalent vs WASM)
- Example workflow: WASM deployment planning
- Common mistakes and FAQ

**When to Use**:
- ✅ Measuring bucket models for WASM deployment
- ✅ Predicting WASM memory requirements
- ❌ Production native deployment (use default settings)

**Example**:
```bash
# WASM-equivalent measurement
DISABLE_MALLOC_TRIM=1 BUCKET_MODEL=8M/8M/8M ENABLE_CUSTOM_BUCKETS=1 ./solver_dev
# → RSS: 241 MB (matches WASM heap)

# Normal native production
BUCKET_MODEL=8M/8M/8M ENABLE_CUSTOM_BUCKETS=1 ./solver_dev
# → RSS: 225 MB (optimized)
```

### 🚀 Depth 10 Local Expansion Design (2026-01-02) - NEW

**[depth_10_expansion_design.md](depth_10_expansion_design.md)** - **Next major feature implementation**
- Background: Depth 10 is the volume peak (~60-70% of all solutions)
- Current limitation: depth 0-9 only (~30% coverage)
- Three implementation options:
  - **Option A**: Direct extension (simplest, 32M bucket, +256 MB)
  - **Option B**: Hybrid pruning (recommended, 16M bucket, +128 MB)
  - **Option C**: Progressive two-stage (most optimized, 8M bucket, +64 MB)
- Memory budget analysis:
  - 8M/8M/8M/32M: Native safe, **WASM exceeds 512MB limit** ❌
  - 8M/8M/8M/16M: Native safe, WASM tight (115%) ⚠️
  - **4M/4M/4M/16M: Both safe (96% WASM utilization)** ✅
- Implementation roadmap (3 phases)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**Key Insights**:
- Depth 10 is THE MOST IMPORTANT depth for xxcross search
- Need 4-depth bucket configuration (current: 3-depth)
- WASM deployment requires careful memory management
- Recommended: Start with Option A (proof of concept), optimize to Option B if needed

**Status**: Design phase complete, ready for implementation

---
  - 16,971 samples at 10ms intervals
  - C++ checkpoint accuracy validated: 656.69 MB vs 657 MB (0.05% difference)
  - 11 memory spikes detected (all normal allocation behavior)
  - **No transient spikes beyond checkpoint values**
  - Production safety confirmed: 657 MB true peak, 943 MB margin (59%)

**Key Findings (Spike Investigation 2026-01-02)**:
- **Hypothesis tested**: "C++ checkpoints may miss high-speed transient spikes"
- **Result**: FALSE - Checkpoints capture true peaks, not "ideal case" approximations
- **Validation method**: 10ms /proc-based monitoring (16,971 samples over 180s)
- **Largest spike**: +27 MB in 10ms during BFS depth 6 (normal bucket allocation)
- **Conclusion**: Checkpoint methodology is comprehensive and accurate ✅

**Production Status**:
- Peak RSS: 657 MB (8M/8M/8M, validated by 10ms monitoring)
- Final RSS: 225 MB (after malloc_trim)
- Safety margin: 943 MB (59% of 1600 MB limit)
- System stable, predictable, and thoroughly validated ✅
- **Ready for production deployment**

- **Conclusion**: Current #ifndef __EMSCRIPTEN__ guard is correct ✅

**Native Results**:
- malloc_trim() effective after multiple allocation cycles
- Reduces final RSS from ~450 MB to ~225 MB
- Critical for production native deployment

**WASM Results**:
- malloc_trim() not available in Emscripten
- Memory managed by Emscripten runtime
